Project overview

For the Reading project, I built a web application for content and comments. My app allow users to post content in pre-defined categories, comment on their own posts and those of other users, and vote on posts and comments. Users can edit and delete posts and comments.

TL;DR

To get started:
- Server
  - First install all project dependencies:
      cd api-server
      npm install
  - Run the Server:
      npm start

- WebSite
  - First install all project dependencies:
      cd frontend
      npm install
  - Run the WebSite:
      npm start
  - Run the tests:
      npm run test
